## Build
There are some dependencies you'll need to build from source. Some people
suggested using the following commands:

### Ubuntu
``` shell
sudo apt install build-essential libkf5config-dev libkdecorations2-dev libqt5x11extras5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev extra-cmake-modules libkf5guiaddons-dev libkf5configwidgets-dev libkf5windowsystem-dev libkf5coreaddons-dev gettext
```

### Arch Linux
``` shell
sudo pacman -S kdecoration qt5-declarative qt5-x11extras    # Decoration
sudo pacman -S cmake extra-cmake-modules                    # Installation
```

### Fedora
``` shell
sudo dnf install cmake extra-cmake-modules  
sudo dnf install "cmake(Qt5Core)" "cmake(Qt5Gui)" "cmake(Qt5DBus)" "cmake(Qt5X11Extras)" "cmake(KF5GuiAddons)" "cmake(KF5WindowSystem)" "cmake(KF5I18n)" "cmake(KDecoration2)" "cmake(KF5CoreAddons)" "cmake(KF5ConfigWidgets)"
```


In order to install the theme and add it to your decorations do the following:
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/wolf-hash/SierraBreeze
cd SierraBreeze
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DKDE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON
sudo make install
```
To avoid logging out, issue
``` shell
kwin_x11 --replace &
```
That is it! Your new decoration theme should appear in
*Settings &rarr; Application Style &rarr; Window Decorations*.
